The osx386 platform
===================

    ack -mosx386 ...

This platform produces Mach-o executables for Intel Mac OS X.  These
are 32-bit executables using our i386 code generator.

See ../osxppc/README, because our osx386 platform has many of the same
limitations and bugs as our osxppc platform.


Bugs
----

Some programs can't read the tty after using job control to suspend
and resume the program (with ^Z and "fg" in bash).  The read(2) system
call fails with EINTR.  In ACK's stdio (in libc), the error is sticky,
so all reads fail.  In Apple's stdio, the error is not sticky, and
only the next read fails.  The EINTR seems to happen only on Intel Mac
OS X, and not on other platforms.
