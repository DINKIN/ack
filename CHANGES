6.1pre1

  Threw away the make-based build system, because it just didn't work. Wrote
  ackbuilder. Many, many little bugfixes and cleanups, too many to remember.

6.0pre4

  Fixed some minor bit-rotting issues that were preventing compilation on
  modern Linux systems.
  
6.0pre3

  Added the cpm platform. Made some optimisations to the i80 code generator,
  including getting topgen up and running and adding some peephole optimiser
  rules. Fixed loads of bugs in ego so that it now works on platforms that
  support it (pc86 and linux386). Made the floating point work on platforms
  that support it (pc86 and linux386 again). Made stdint.h work. Lots and lots
  of bugfixes and tweaks everywhere.
  
6.0pre2

  Much simplified the syscall interface by disabling libmon and instead
  calling the syscalls directly. Disabled the K&R C compiler and libc because
  it doesn't actually gain us anything and has a high maintenance load --- the
  ANSI C compiler works fine with K&R C. Adapted the rest of the system to
  build with the ANSI C compiler. Rewrote the pc86 syscall interface and added
  linux386 support, using the i386 code generator. Lots and lots of bugfixes
  and tweaks everywhere.
  
6.0pre1

  First working version of the 6.0 release stream. Working frontends: both C
  compilers, Pascal, Modula-2, Basic and Occam. Working backends: i86. Working
  platforms: pc86, the very noddy testbed setup that produces floppy disk
  images.
